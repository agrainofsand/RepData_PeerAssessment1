## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r,echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("/Users/agrainofsand/Documents/coursera_datascience/5 Reproducible Research/activity.csv",
                     stringsAsFactors=F)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$Date)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r,echo=TRUE}
group_by_date <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
hist(group_by_date$steps, main = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps per Day", xlab="Steps")
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
